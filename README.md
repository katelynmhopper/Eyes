# Eyes
## Description
This project creates two eyes in the center of the webpage that follow the movement of your mouse on the screen. 
## How to Run
The code for creating and moving the pacmen are in the index.html file where you can see the complete code. Try to come up with the solution on your own and then take the code and see what you can do with it.
## Roadmap of future improvements
In the future I would like to play around with the colors of the eyes possibly and maybe changing the shape. I also want to try different inputs so instead of following the mouse maybe it's where you click just to see some different variations.
